# curated-aur

A [curated](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/v97zei/launching_a_curated_aur_hosted_on_github/) repository of package recipies for Arch Linux. This complements the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository).

## Usage

The primary way is to use the [ymerge](https://github.com/flying-dude/ymerge) package manager to install and remove packages.

Alternatively, you can work with the git repository directly, if you want. Use `git clone` to fetch packages and `git pull` to keep updated.
This is how you would install the [odin](https://github.com/flying-dude/curated-aur/tree/main/pkg/odin) package:

```
git clone https://github.com/flying-dude/curated-aur
cd curated-aur/pkg/odin
makepkg -si
```

## Whitelisting AUR Packages

The file
[aur-whitelist.json](https://github.com/flying-dude/curated-aur/tree/main/aur-whitelist.json)
contains a (long) list of packages from the Arch Linux
[AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository),
that have been reviewed and accepted for usage with packages in this repository.

You can add more entries to the list of accepted packages, by using the
[aur-whitelist](https://github.com/flying-dude/curated-aur/tree/main/scripts/aur-whitelist)
script.
The script will automatically update the whitelist and print new entries to the command line.

```
Usage: aur-whitelist [-h|--help] [--config mylist.json] <packages...>

Whitelist Arch Linux AUR package to be included in the curated AUR.
This will save the name of the package together with the most recent git commit id.

Example:
    Whitelist latest version of xmake and build2 AUR packages:
    $ aur-whitelist xmake build2
```

Note that the script will auto-detect the file system location of the whitelist file
[relative](https://github.com/flying-dude/curated-aur/blob/cfe3f9a10e468c90f23317de7a4390abfd083ab8/scripts/aur-whitelist#L33)
to its own position.
So if you just clone the git repo and then run the whitelist script inside that repo, it will find the correct whitelist file and update its entries:

```
$ https://github.com/flying-dude/curated-aur
$ cd curated-aur
$ ./scripts/aur-whitelist xmake build2 archivemount mount-zip
2ae835df306f3541e0384f6803f5972fedc3aad8 xmake
4424cce8e2f4d87fa54b1b53a354dec7d784e8f9 build2
e04e7dacb8d60a0c263fefb94f0dac20829ce515 archivemount
59809caf1ab342df88d60beb6dcc26fa8d2b8572 mount-zip
$ cat aur-whitelist.json
{
    "archivemount": "e04e7dacb8d60a0c263fefb94f0dac20829ce515",
    "build2": "4424cce8e2f4d87fa54b1b53a354dec7d784e8f9",
    "mount-zip": "59809caf1ab342df88d60beb6dcc26fa8d2b8572",
    "xmake": "42262f834457dcfeb97c4888b06cc39f59f32ab3"
}
```
